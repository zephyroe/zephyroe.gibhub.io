            Hello! I'm Zephaniah, a first-year student at the University of
            Chicago. I am currently studying comuter science but am also
            interested in classical studies, philosphy, and art. As a curious
            person, pursueing so many subjects and activities, it was
            difficult to narrow this page down. So instead of trying to include
            everything, I broke this page into 3 main categories: computer
            science, art, and effective altruism. If you are interested in
            reading about only one or two of these subjects, feel free to skip
            ahead. This page can be read in any order.

          <p id="cs-text" class="section-text">
            My love for computer science began with a much more general love of
            engineering and an appetite for invention. As a child, I built
            things out of anything I could get my hands on. I made cars out of
            legos, forts out of leaves, costumes out of balloons, and furniture
            out of scrap wood I found digging through garbage.
            <br><br>
            In 6th grade, I joined my middle school’s VEX robotics club. Because
            I was a beginner, I was placed on a team with five other kids who
            also had limited experience building robots. But despite our lack of
            prior experience, we shocked everyone and went on to win the state
            championship. In retrospect, I realize that it didn’t really matter
            that we didn’t go into robotics with a lot of technical knowledge
            because we had what really mattered – a restless desire to create.
            <br><br>
            That same desire, that made me succeed in robotics, is what made me
            want to learn how to code. I was fascinated by the things that could
            be created with code and excited by the future I could help build by
            using code responsibly. But when I began learning to program, I
            found myself in the same position I was in when I started robotics
            in middle school. I was almost a complete beginner, overwhelmed by
            what I didn’t know. But once again, I overcame my lack of prior
            experience with hard work and dedication. I spent countless hours
            self-studying web development and learning the basics of programming.
            I enrolled in programming classes in high school and college and
            mastered the required material and more. Through this experience, I
            learned the principles of coding (with Java and Python) and the
            fundamentals of front end web development (with HTML and CSS).
            <br><br>
            Over the time I have spent learning to program, I have written lots
            of code in a variety of languages. But this website is a special
            milestone for me because it is my first complete project I have made
            available to the public. For more information about this website

          <p class="section-text">
            Since I was old enough to hold a pencil or paintbrush, I have been
            fascinated by art. As a toddler, I spent hours drawing and painting
            pictures that vaguely represented people, animals, and flowers.
            However, as I got older, my art became increasingly sophisticated.
            I improved my drawing and painting skills and began experimenting
            with different concepts, subjects, and mediums.

          <p class="section-text">
            In fourth grade, I started making balloon animals. I began with
            simple designs such as dogs and flowers, but as I improved my
            skills, I moved on to creating more advanced sculptures, competing
            in national competitions and making balloons professionally. Over
            the years, I have mastered all common balloon-twisting techniques
            and have made costumes, expansive displays, and clothing. My most
            proud accomplishment in balloon twisting however, is that by making
            so many balloons for so many people, I believe that I have genuinely
            made the world a little happier.
            <br><br>
            Although I spent lots of time making balloons, I still pursued a
            traditional art education. In high school I took classes in drawing,
            painting, and wheel throwing. I have learned how to apply important
            artistic concepts to my work and have studied a number of artists
            and countless pieces. Although this was an extremely useful
            experience, learning how to make balloons was equally essential to
            me becoming a great artist. Because I had more than a traditional
            art education, I learned how to not only embrace the beauty in the
            world through focused study, but also how to share it by making
            balloon animals.

          <h2>Effective Altruism:</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            Effective altruism is the idea that we can and should use evidence
            and reasoning to find the most impactful ways to improve the world.
            This idea plays out in a number of ways: effective altruists donate
            money to high impact charities, dedicate their careers to solving
            pressing problems, and do global priorities research on which
            actions cause the most positive impactful.
            <br><br>
            Effective altruism is distinctly different from other social justice
            movements because it is driven by objective thinking and high
            quality research. Additionally, it encourages people to reject their
            own biases and focus on the values and preferences of the people in
            the communities they are trying to help. For example, many effective
            altruists support Give Direct, a charity that provides universal
            basic income to people living in poor countries. This charity does
            not only stand up to extensive scrutiny but it also has the values
            of their recipients built into the structure of the organization.
            Because Give Direct gives out unconditional cash transfers,
            recipients are able to determine what they and their family need
            the most, independent from the biases and preconceptions of the
            people running the charity.
            <br><br>
            In my own life, I discovered the value of community-involvement in
            my own acts of community service. In high school, I volunteered at
            Camp Anokijig, a sleepaway camp in Wisconsin. Because I had spent
            years there as a camper, as a staff member, I was familiar with the
            needs, traditions, and culture of the camp. My understanding of the
            Camp Anokijig community ultimately enabled me to support the
            children at the camp in more meaningful ways and increase the
            positve impact I had on the camp.

            </figure>

          <p class="section-text">
            Similarly, when I finished high school I wanted to give back to my
            community so I took on a job running a day camp at my town’s park
            district, the Park District of Oak Park. The camp was open to
            everyone, but many of the parents that signed their kids up
            needed to work during the day and could not afford babysitters.
            Because I had grown up in the community, I understood that programs
            like these allowed families to be financially stable and that the
            quality of these types of programs were essential to the wellbeing
            of the community.
            <br><br>
            Going forward, I hope to build on my experience at Camp Anokijig and
            the Park District of Oak Park and increase my impact by working for
            programs that are even more effective. In the future, I hope I will
            be able to work on issues such as global poverty, animal welfare,
            nuclear security, or AI risk. I understand that this is a process,
            and that I may need to work in a variety of different kinds of jobs
            to build up important skills. But no matter what jobs I take or what
            areas I choose to work in, my goal will always be the same – to
            genuinely improve the world.

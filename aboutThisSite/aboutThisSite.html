          <h2>How I made this site:</h2>
          <p>
            This site is coded almost entirely with HTML(hyper text markup
            language) and CSS(cascading style sheets). HTML is used to control
            what content goes on a given site and CSS is used to control how
            that content looks. For example, if one wanted to add a title to a
            website, they would type it in between an opening and closing h1 tag
            in HTML. If one then wanted to change the color of that text, to blue
            for example, they would use CSS, probably saying something like
            “h1 {color: blue}”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because CSS is typically used for aesthetic purposes, one could code
            a website entirely out of HTML. But the resulting site would end up
            looking bare and may confuse the user. For example, the image below
            shows how the home page of this site may look without CSS.
          </p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img class="noCSS-image" src="noCSSlarge.png" alt="What the home page of the website would look like without CSS">
          </div>
          <p>
            When you add back the CSS, the site looks something like this:
          </p>
          <div class="image-container">
            <img src="indexLarge.png" alt="What the home page of the website would look like with CSS">
          </div>
          <p>
            By using CSS and HTML together, developers are able to create
            responsive and professional looking websites. I believe that my work
            on this site illustrates that and shows my proficiency in both HTML
            and CSS. But with that being said, there are still some things
            about this site that could use improvement. I discuss that below.
          </p>
          <h2>How this site could be improved:</h2>
          <h3>1. Better coding practices:</h3>
          <p class="list-item">
            The biggest problem with this site is the way that many elements are
            built on the measurement “em.” This measurement is the browser text
            size, typically 16 pixels, but can be changed by users depending on
            their preferences. On the website, I built lots of elements surrounding
            text in ems because I thought it would enable the website to be more
            responsive. I discovered, however, that in some cases, this can lead
            to problems. In the future, I will ensure to only use ems on text
            when it makes sense and use them sparingly as a measurement for
            non-text elements on the website.
          </p>

          <p class="list-item">
            Another coding problem this site has is that a lot of CSS is longer
            than it needs to be and is poorly organized. Also, the heads of the
            HTML files could be configured better. Both these problems shouldn’t
            be too difficult to solve and in the near future I will update the
            website with these changes.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Accessibility:</h3>
          <p class="list-item">
            In the process of coding this website, I only very briefly consulted
            an online resource to help make the page accessible to all users.
            For this reason, I strongly suspect that there are major
            accessibility problems on the site. I am planning on fixing these
            issues in the near future.
